### What is it:
YouTube Video Downloader is a GUI Application that allows users to download videos from the web, based on the CLI program ['yt-dlp'](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) YouTube Video Downloader strives to be easy to use for both beginner and advanced users, allowing for simple and straightforward downloading no matter the use case. Support for Windows and MacOS.

### Why does it exist:
The YouTube Video Downloader first came about due to a need to make downloading media from the web very simple for those with no or little knowledge of how to use command line programs. This later expanded somewhat when a user wanted more control over how media he downloaded was saved, and a mode was added with greater control for advanced users.
